My Cloud File Storage


This is a simple client/server program that takes four different commands: get, del, put and list.

"get" will get data from the server and store into a file specified by the user. It also prints it out the stdout.

"del" will delete a file specified by the user.

"put" will take data from stdin and store in into a file on the server.

"list" will list all of the files curretly on the server.

The server application will stay open until closed by the server user. The client closes its connection after every task.
